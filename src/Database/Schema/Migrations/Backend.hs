-- | A Backend represents a database engine backend such as MySQL or
--  SQLite.  A Backend supplies relatively low-level functions for
--  inspecting the backend's state, applying migrations, and reverting
--  migrations.  A Backend also supplies the migration necessary to
--  "bootstrap" a backend so that it can track which migrations are
--  installed.
data Backend = Backend
  { getBootstrapMigration :: IO Migration
  -- ^ The migration necessary to bootstrap a database with
  -- this connection interface. This might differ slightly
  -- from one backend to another.
  , isBootstrapped :: IO Bool
  -- ^ Returns whether the backend has been bootstrapped. A
  -- backend has been bootstrapped if is capable of tracking
  -- which migrations have been installed; the "bootstrap
  -- migration" provided by getBootstrapMigration should
  -- suffice to bootstrap the backend.
  , applyMigration :: Migration -> IO ()
  -- ^ Apply the specified migration on the backend.
  -- applyMigration does NOT assume control of the
  -- transaction, since it expects the transaction to
  -- (possibly) cover more than one applyMigration operation.
  -- The caller is expected to call commit at the appropriate
  -- time. If the application fails, the underlying SqlError
  -- is raised and a manual rollback may be necessary; for
  -- this, see withTransaction from HDBC.
  , revertMigration :: Migration -> IO ()
  -- ^ Revert the specified migration from the backend and
  -- record this action in the table which tracks installed
  -- migrations. revertMigration does NOT assume control of
  -- the transaction, since it expects the transaction to
  -- (possibly) cover more than one revertMigration operation.
  -- The caller is expected to call commit at the appropriate
  -- time. If the revert fails, the underlying SqlError is
  -- raised and a manual rollback may be necessary; for this,
  -- see withTransaction from HDBC. If the specified migration
  -- does not supply a revert instruction, this has no effect
  -- other than bookkeeping.
  , getMigrations :: IO [Text]
  -- ^ Returns a list of installed migration names from the
  -- backend.
  , commitBackend :: IO ()
  -- ^ Commit changes to the backend.
  , rollbackBackend :: IO ()
  -- ^ Revert changes made to the backend since the current
  -- transaction began.
  , disconnectBackend :: IO ()
  -- ^ Disconnect from the backend.
